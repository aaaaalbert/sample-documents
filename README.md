# Secure Systems Lab Templates

Welcome to the [Secure Systems Lab (SSL)](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/)
Templates repo! Below you can find example documents usually available in our
project repos.  These templates can be modified to suit a project's needs, and
many of them can even satisfy some of the requirements for the [Core
Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices
Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/).

* Acknowledgements -- A project's README should
[acknowledge](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) who manages the project and indicate any
grants that might support the project.

* Governance -- Our projects should be transparent about
[governance](GOVERNANCE.md) procedures and the handling of contributions.  Who
are the maintainers of the project?  How are maintainers added and removed?

* Vulnerability reports -- Contributors and users of a project should be given
instructions on how to submit [vulnerability reports](vulnerability-reports.md)
and bugs.

* Maintainers -- Document who [maintains](MAINTAINERS.txt) the project and any
relevant information about the maintainer(s), such as email address, PGP keys,
etc.

* Roadmap --

* Pylint configuration --

* Travis configuration --

* Tox configuration --

* Dependency management --

* GitHub issue template -- Feature requests or bug reports should contain
sufficient information that others can use to implement the feature or
reproduce the bug.  An [issue template](.github/ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md) can be added
to a GitHub repository that is presented to users when they attempt to create a
new issue.

* GitHub pull request template -- Like the GitHub issue template, users
can be given a [skeleton of the pull request
summary](.github/PULL-REQUEST-TEMPLATE.md) when they try to submit a pull
request.  GitHub templates should encourage users to provide enough information
that is helpful to others.
