# Secure Systems Lab Templates

Welcome to the [Secure Systems Lab (SSL)](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/)
Templates repo! Below you can find example documents usually available in our
project repos.  These templates can be modified to suit a project's needs, and
many of them can even satisfy some of the requirements for the [Core
Infrastructure Initiative (CII) Best Practices
Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/).


* Acknowledgements -- A project's README should
* [acknowledge](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) who manages
the project and indicate any grants that might support the project.

* Governance -- Our projects should be transparent about
[management](GOVERNANCE.md) procedures and the handling of contributions.  Who
are the maintainers of the project?  How are maintainers added and removed?

* Roadmap --

* Pylint configuration --
